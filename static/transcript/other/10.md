I don't think we should do this anymore, I just want a casual relationship and it's clear that you want something more.

what? not at all, I also want a 100% casual relationship

you do?

absolutely.

oh wow.

All I ask is on days we shab boink that you take me out first so I don't feel like you're using me.

That seems totally fair.

And I don't know maybe you could just text me a few times throughout the week, just to check in on me and see how I'm doing.

Yeah, of course.

And if I'm ever moving I would expect you to help me as a common courtesy.

I'm not a monster.

Oh one thing if you do horizontal Monster Mash with someone else you do need to let me know.

huh why is that?

Because if you're seeing other people I may decide I don't want to be a part of that.

Oh because I'm looking for an exclusive hookup buddy.

So shab boinking whenever I want but just with you.

Exactly.

That sounds like a good deal.

And I need you to keep an open mind about wanting more in the future.

Like more hooking up ?

Like becoming roommates and living together.

Then I wouldn't have to drive so far to shaboink you, wow, you're so smart.

what can I say I'm not like other girls.

If I'm being honest I didn't think you'd be so open to this casual hookup thing. So what do you say should we go upstairs to celebrate.

Totally, but I'm so hungry could we grab a bite to eat first?

Do you want me to order in some sweet green

I was thinking we could go out to that Steakhouse on third oh that really fancy one.

Yeah we could even celebrate this every year on this day.

Hold on that sounds like a great idea.

Yeah, let's go

Do you mind putting on something nicer?

Uh yeah I'll throw on a nicer shirt sorry hen
