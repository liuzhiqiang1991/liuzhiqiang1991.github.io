1、Design Principle

The Open-Closed Principle： Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Our goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behavior without modifying existing code.

What do we get if we accomplish this?

Designs that are resilient to change and flexible enough to take on new functionality to meet changing requirements.


The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
