1、Someone has already solved your problems.

In this chapter, you’ll learn why (and how) you can exploit the wisdom and lessons learned by other developers who’ve been down the same design problem road and survived the trip.

Before we’re done, we’ll look at the use and benefits of design patterns, look at some key object-oriented (OO) design principles, and walk through an example of how one pattern works.

The best way to use patterns is to load your brain with them and then recognize places in your designs and existing applications where you can apply them.

Instead of code reuse, with patterns you get experience reuse.



2、Design Principle

Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

Program to an interface, not an implementation.

Favor composition over inheritance.

3、Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
