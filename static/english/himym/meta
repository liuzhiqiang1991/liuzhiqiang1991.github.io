01_1, So. These guys think I chickened out. What do you think?
01_2, Hi. Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
01_3, Carl. did you know the word "karaoke" is Japanese for "empty orchestra"? Isn't that hauntly beautiful? Are you a vampire?
02_1, Robin. look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that. (Robin smiles) I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.
02_2, Yeah. that's right...a limo.
02_3, God. that sucks. man. I'm so sorry.
03_1, Could have licked the liberty bell.
03_2, All right. Marshall. we're deciding right now who get's this apartment. May lead to an argument. but we're setting this.
03_3, Hey. Robin. top of the morning. Hi. Robin. Good sweater.
04_1, Hello again. I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.
04_2, This is going to be great.
04_3, You know. I should tell you. I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings.
05_1, I don't get it. Man. Natalie is awesome.
05_2, I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fianc√©.
05_3, Well. Derek and I just broke up.
06_1, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT.
06_2, Ted. Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.
06_3, Change your personality? That is so awful. and not at all motivational.
07_1, He's a whole new species. The cock-mouse.
07_2, Stuart. I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...
07_3, But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest. then you "Marshall out" and all your chips go into the pot. and remember. if you ever ask the question "What?". then... you got to drink. Got it?
09_1, This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.
09_2, Why did we think that guy was Moby?
09_3, Okay. Robin. your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left. which... Victoria!
10_1, Your boat is sinking. That was good.
10_2, So. wait. not only have you not done any good for anyone today. you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know. Ted. it's called Thanksgiving. not Thankstaking. Damn.
10_3, Five weeks later. we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.
