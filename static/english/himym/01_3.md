Ted:  Carl, did you know the word "karaoke" is Japanese  for "empty orchestra"? Isn't that hauntly
      beautiful? Are you a vampire?

Carl: All right, I'm cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.

Ted:  Year, ths sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we? Hey, how easy do you think
      it would be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguine, like, right now.

Carl: All right, give me your arm.

Ted:  Okay.

Carl: This way, if you pass out in the gutter...

Ted:  It tickles.

Carl: ...someone will call me, and I will come get you.

Ted:  Thanks, Carl. We can't just be friends. We're attract to each other, and we both know it.

Carl: Excuse me ?

Ted:  Me and Robin, me and Robin. I have to make one more call.

Carl: Year, that'll go good.

Ted:  Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other.
      We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway - and we only get one life. So, why don't you come
      over to my apartment right now, and we'll think of somegthing stupid to do together? Really?
      Great. Wait. Really? Great. Thanks, Carl. It's Robin. That's Robin in there.
