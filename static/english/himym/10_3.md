Barney: Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.

[END OF FLASHBACK]

Robin: She never showed?

Ted: So, what happened next?

Barney: You know what? This was a mistake.

Lily: Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?

Marshall: Oh, I know just how to decide who.

Lily: You brought the game to the bar?

Marshall: Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.

Ted: I was winning?

Robin: Fine. I'll go next.
[FLASHBACK]

Robin: I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.

[END OF FLASHBACK]

Barney: Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!

Ted: Yeah, we all know that one.

Victoria: Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.

Marshall: Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!

Victoria: Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.

Ted from 2030: Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories, but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one. Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.

Marshall: That is the greatest story ever!

Lily: Oh my God!

Ted: Wow, wow!

Barney: Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.
