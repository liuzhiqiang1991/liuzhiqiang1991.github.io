Barney: Why did we think that guy was Moby?

Ted: I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.

Barney: That's Marshall's phone. Hello.

Lily: Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.

Barney: Hey, sexy.

Lily: Barney, where's Marshall?

Barney: He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.

Lily: What? Where?

Barney: Party number three.

Lily: Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!

Barney: Moby?! She's upstairs.

Ted: Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.

Lily: Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a g*n?


Ted: Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?

(Lily comes in)

Lily: Who was that guy?!

Barney: Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.

Ted: Ranjit, drive!

Ranjit: Where to?

Ted: Party number three!

Ranjit: Party number three!

Lily: No, but I was just at party number three.

Ted: No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.

Barney: Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!


Ted: Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule.
