      Barney: Could have licked the liberty bell.
      Ted:    We are going to the airport.
      Barney: Bang ... Bang ...
      Ted:    Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer
              at my regular bar with my regular friends in my regular city.
      Barney: Ted, Ted, Ted. You're not event looking.
      Ted:    No, I'm not.
      Barney: Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of hapiness, okey? Not for the
              sit around and wait of hapiness. Now, if you want, you can go to the same
              bar, drink the same beer, talk to the same people every day, or you can lick
              the liberty bell. You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it.

      Leonard:That was beautiful, man.
      Barney: Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you are missing out of a valuable life lesson here.
      Ted:    Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okey? I know how to live.
              If you watn to go lick the liberty bell, just go lick it yourself.
      Barney: No, it has to be the two of us.

      Ted:    Why? Why do you need me?
      Barney: Because you are my best friend, all right? You don't have to say I'm yours,
              but the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm ... I'm just the dynamic uno.
              So, fine, if you want to go home, then we'll go home.
      Ted:    Fine. We'll go lick the libery bell.
      Barney: Good 'cause we're here.
      Ted:    I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out.
              Dina let us in, and by god, we lick the liberty bell. You know what it taste like?
      Woman:  What?
      Ted:    Freedom. No, actually, it tastes like pennies.
      Woman:  Oh, my god. Did you guys really do that?
      Ted:    We really did. And that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got
              where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story.
