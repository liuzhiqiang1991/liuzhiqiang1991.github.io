    Trying to do calculus without using functions would be one of the most pointless things you could do.
    If calculus had an ingredients list, functions would be first on it, and by some margin too.
    So, the first two chapters of this book are designed to jog your memory about the main features of functions.
    This chapter contains a review of the following topics ...

    It turns out that it’s pretty tricky to define a limit properly, but you can get an intuitive understanding of limits even without going into the gory details.
    This will be enough to tackle differentiation and integration.
    So, this chapter contains only the intuitive version; check out Appendix A for the formal version. All in all, here’s what we’ll look at in this chapter ...
