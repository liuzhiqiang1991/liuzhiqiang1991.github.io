### 错误代码
```
    public class RyanAndMonicaTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
            RyanAndMonicaJob ryan = new RyanAndMonicaJob("Ryan", account, 50);
            RyanAndMonicaJob monica = new RyanAndMonicaJob("Monica", account, 100);
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
            executor.execute(ryan);
            executor.execute(monica);
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }

    class RyanAndMonicaJob implements Runnable {
        private final String name;
        private final BankAccount account;
        private final int amountToSpend;
        RyanAndMonicaJob(String name, BankAccount account, int amountToSpend) {
            this.name = name;
            this.account = account;
            this.amountToSpend = amountToSpend;
        }
        public void run() {
            goShopping(amountToSpend);
        }
        private void goShopping(int amount) {
            if (account.getBalance() >= amount) {
                System.out.println(name + " is about to spend");
                account.spend(amount);
                System.out.println(name + " finishes spending");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Sorry, not enough for " + name);
            }
        }
    }

    class BankAccount {
        private int balance = 100;
        public int getBalance() {
            return balance;
        }
        public void spend(int amount) {
            balance = balance - amount;
            if (balance < 0) {
                System.out.println("Overdrawn!");
            }
        }
    }
```

### 锁住对象, 可以确定持有account对象的线程，只有一个能执行代码块
```
    private void goShopping(int amount) {
        synchronized (account) {
            if (account.getBalance() >= amount) {
                System.out.println(name + " is about to spend");
                account.spend(amount);
                System.out.println(name + " finishes spending");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Sorry, not enough for " + name);
            }
        }
    }
```

### 重点
```
    The locks are not per method, they are per object.
    If an object has two synchronized methods,
    it doesn’t only mean two threads can’t enter
    the same method. It means you can’t have
    two threads entering any of the synchronized
    methods. If you have two synchronized methods on the
    same object, method1() and method2(), if one thread is in
    method1(), a second thread can’t enter method1(), obviously,
    but it also can’t enter method2(), or any other synchronized
    method on that object.
```

#### 错误示例

```
    private synchronized void goShopping(int amount) {
        if (account.getBalance() >= amount) {
            System.out.println(name + " is about to spend");
            account.spend(amount);
            System.out.println(name + " finishes spending");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, not enough for " + name);
        }
    }

    The synchronized keyword locks an object. The goShopping() method is in RyanAndMonicaJob.
    Synchronizing an instance method means “lock this RyanAndMonicaJob
    instance.” However, there are two instances of RyanAndMonicaJob; one is “ryan,”
    and the other is “monica.” If “ryan” is locked, “monica” can still make changes to
    the bank account; she doesn’t care that the “ryan” job is locked.

    The object that needs locking, the object these two threads are fighting over, is the BankAccount.
    Putting synchronized on a method in RyanAndMonicaJob (and locking a RyanAndMonicaJob instance) isn’t going to solve anything.
```


#### 正确样例2
```
    class RyanAndMonicaJob implements Runnable {
        private final String name;
        private final BankAccount account;
        private final int amountToSpend;
        RyanAndMonicaJob(String name, BankAccount account, int amountToSpend) {
            this.name = name;
            this.account = account;
            this.amountToSpend = amountToSpend;
        }

        public void run() {
            goShopping(amountToSpend);
        }

        private void goShopping(int amount) {
            System.out.println(name + " is about to spend");
            account.spend(name, amount);
            System.out.println(name + " finishes spending");
        }
    }

    class BankAccount {
        private int balance = 100;
        public int getBalance() {
            return balance;
        }
        public synchronized void spend(String name, int amount) {
            if (balance >= amount) {
                balance = balance - amount;
                if (balance < 0) {
                    System.out.println("Overdrawn!");
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("Sorry, not enough for " + name);
            }
        }
    }
```
