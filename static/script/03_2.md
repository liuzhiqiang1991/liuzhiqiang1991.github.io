      Ted:      All right, Marshall, we're deciding right now who get's this apartment.
                May lead to an argument, but we're setting this.

      Marshall: Or we could flip a coin.

      Ted:      Year, let's flip a coin.

      Marshall: Flip it.

      Ted:      Okay, I'm flipping it. Here I go.

      Marshall: Flip it.

      Ted:      Okay, here I go.

      Marshall: Flip it.

      Ted:      I'm flipping. But before I do. I just want to say something. You didn't even
                want to move in here in the first place. You said a pre war building was bad
                for your allergies.

      Marshall: That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over
                the counter. Oh, snap. What else you got?

      Ted:      Okay. I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

      Marshall: You don't need two rooms.

      Ted:      Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms.

      Marshall: We might be starting a family soon.

      Ted:      Oh, no, you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're still in
                law school. It's going to be at least three years.

      Marshall: It could be sooner. We're not that careful with our birth control. Two-zip.

      Ted:      Oh, come on! You know damn well, I move out, the room's goint unused.

      Marshall: Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate. Who's it going to be, Barney? You
                know he cooks naked.

      Ted:      Year, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the sorts down. We were bros! These
                swords represent our broohood. And you took them down to make room to your
                finacee's stupid painting?

      Marshall: My finacee? Suddently she's my fiancee? Lily's part of who I am. And if you're
                Such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension.

      Ted:      I deserve this apartment, Marshall.

      Marshall: No more than I do.

      Ted:      Great. So let's flip for it.

      Marshall: Flip it.
