    Ted:    Hello again.

    Sarah:  I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.

    Ted:    Go ahead, Sarah. You can tell me anything.

    Sarah:  You have a basal cell carcinoma.

    Ted:    Anything else?

    Sarah:  Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening.
            But we should excise the rest of it.

    Ted:    Wait, then you're still getting married?

    Sarah:  Of course I'm still getting married.

    Ted:    But we're a 9.6.

    Sarah:  Excuse me?

    Ted:    Okay. I went to love solutions, and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer, that you
            and I are a 9.6. Your fiance is only an 8.5.

    Sarah:  You looked at my file?

    Ted:    I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious?
            The woman wo set you up with your fiance, thinks we're a better match.

    Sarah:  I am getting married on Saturday.

    Ted:    Summer breeze...

    Sarah:  Ted.

    Ted:    Look, don't you think you're a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met
            a few months ago?

    Sarah:  Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to propose an engaged woman you don't even know?

    Ted:    See? We're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.

    Sarah:  Ted, just calm down.

    Ted:    Calm down? You're my only match. God, there was a computer and there were eight fish in a sea full of
            lesbians and ...

    Sarah:  Okay, Ted, Ted. Do you really believe, deep down, that there is no one out there for you just because
            some computer says so?

    Ted:    I didn't used to. But there was math, I got confused.

    Sarah:  Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, an 8.5
            equals a perfect ten.

    Ted:    You're right.
