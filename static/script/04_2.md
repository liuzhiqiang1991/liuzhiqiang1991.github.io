    Robin:  This is going to be great.

    Ted:    I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people,
            giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man.
            These has got to be the best people in New York.

    Barney: ... to grandmother's house. Excuse me, guys. Coming through.

    Ted:    Barney?

    Barney: Well, hi guys.

    Ted:    What are you doing here?

    Barney: Oh, just the Lord's work.

    Ted:    But you're Satan.

    Barney: Guys, okay, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here.
            I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie
            of incredibly hot guys.

    Robin:  This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here.

    Kendall:Barney, we need you out front. There's a logjam on the stuffing line.
            Can you show them how it's done?

    Barney: I'm on it.

    Ted:    Wait, so this is real? Barney does this?

    Kendall:Every Sunday, all year long. He's out best volunteer.

    Barney: That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.

    Ted:    Anyway, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?

    Kendall:Uh, go home. We're full.

    Robin:  What?

    Ted:    We're volunteer. We're unpaid help. Can you ever really have enough unpaid help?

    Kendall:On the biggest volunteer day of the year? Yeah, you can.

    Robin:  Come on, we just want to help out.

    Barney: Kendall, they're cool.

    Kendall:Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here. We'll let you know if we need you.

    Barney: Okay, well, I'd better get back out there. There's a lot of food to give out.
            And a lot of similes.
